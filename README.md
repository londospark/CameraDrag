## Getting started

- Rename the `src\SkylinesMod.csproj` file to whatever you want your mod to be called.
- Run `dotnet tool restore` to get the build tools needed for the project.
- Run `dotnet fake build -t Build` to compile your mod
- Run `dotnet fake build -t Install` to install the mod into your Cities: Skylines game.
